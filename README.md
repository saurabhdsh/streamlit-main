Hi :wave:, and welcome to the Streamlit Tutorial Series.

## Installing Streamlit
You can use the requirements.txt file to install all of the required libraries, or if you already have pandas and numpy, you can just install streamlit by opening a command prompt / terminal and typing in `pip install streamlit`

## Running Streamlit
Once Streamlit has been installed you can run the select file by typing the following in the command prompt/terminal:

`streamlit run app_p1.py`
